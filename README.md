# createtable.github.io
My own mini-project. Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, a simple page has been created to create tables with any number of rows and columns. It is also possible to give the table a title, make changes anywhere in the table (add or delete data). If desired, it is possible to save the table with all changes in PDF format.
Procedure for use:
1. Enter the name of the table or fill in the default.
2 and 3. Enter the number of columns and columns (numbers only!). Or leave it as default.
4. Click on the !Create Table! button.
5. Next, a table according to your requests appears.
6. Fill in the table with any of your data, you can edit it if necessary.
7. Click the Save to PDF button - your table is automatically saved to your device in PDF format with all your changes.

P.S.: I really hope you liked my project.
I would appreciate your comments and suggestions.
